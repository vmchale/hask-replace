# Speed
  ~~- [ ] evaluate the parallelism~~
# Ergonomics
  - [ ] prompt before replacement
  - [ ] optionally proceed if no config file is found.
  - [ ] if we replace a `parser.cabal` file, and it's in a directory called
    `parser`, we should rename the directory too.
  - [x] vim plugin/wrapper
    - [ ] nice diff output like vim-hare
    - [ ] should optionally move spec files as well
  - [x] should optionally move spec files as well
  ~~- [ ] allow user to input module name or file name~~
  - [ ] git stash instead of git commit? make it automatic, ideally.
