# Speed
  - [ ] evaluate the parallelism
  - [ ] look at what tokei does re: reading only parts of a file
  - [ ] look at what ripgrep does (since it's faster??)
# Ergonomics
  - [ ] prompt before replacement
  - [x] vim plugin/wrapper
    - [ ] nice diff output like vim-hare
  - [ ] should optionally move spec files as well
  - [ ] allow user to input module name or file name
# Features
  - [ ] move functions between modules
  ~~- [ ] rename a function across modules~~
# Bugs
  - [x] have to run it from the parent directory
  - [x] Overzealous matches when replacing
