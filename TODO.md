# Speed
  - [ ] evaluate the parallelism
  - [ ] look at what tokei does re: reading only parts of a file
  - [ ] look at what ripgrep does (since it's faster??)
# Ergonomics
  - [ ] prompt before replacement
  - [x] vim plugin/wrapper
  - [ ] should move spec files as well
  - [ ] allow user to input module name or file name
# Features
  - [ ] move functions between modules
# Bugs
  - [ ] have to run it from the parent directory
  - [x] Overzealous matches when replacing
